Used nonce accounts can be deleted once they are used to claim the rent back.

<RequestExample>

```bash API
curl -X DELETE "https://yournonciinstance.com/nonce/delete/<nonce_id>" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <secret>"
```

```ts SDK
await nonci.deleteNonceById(<nonce_id>);
```

</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json Response
{
    "message": "Nonce deleted successfully",
    "signature": "2kUK4LckoY28CGbubAT8hT7jjEKgkA6p5NqfJJRyHMd43VRpWLSiMhyCFoQrRRWwamWwsZbR6vAUUkRcoWoXxP3B"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

If you want to delete all used nonces at once, you can use the bulk delete endpoint -

<CodeGroup>
```bash API
curl -X DELETE "https://yournonciinstance.com/nonce/all-used \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <secret>"
```

```ts SDK
await nonci.deleteUsedNonces();
```

```json Response
{
  "message": "All used nonces deleted successfully",
  "number": 69
}
```

</CodeGroup>
