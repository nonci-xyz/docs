Nonci is a simple, yet powerful tool for queuing transactions and executing them asynchronously using durable nonces to handle crazy bursts in transactions. This tool is inspired by [this tweet from Armani](https://twitter.com/armaniferrante/status/1644755048436736001).

Ideally it is meant for NFTs but the infrastructure is generic enough to be used for any type of transaction.
