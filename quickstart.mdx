### Prerequisites

- MongoDB instance, you can create a free on on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- RabbitMQ instance, you can create a free one on [CloudAMQP](https://www.cloudamqp.com/)
- Node.js 16 or higher

### Setup

Firstly, clone the repository by running the following command -

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nonci-xyz/api.git
```

Now, install the dependencies -

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i
```

```bash yarn
yarn
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm i
```

</CodeGroup>

Now run the `setup.sh` script -

```
./setup.sh
```

This will create an API secret and a keypair for the Nonci vault and populate a default `.env` file where you can add the MongoDB and RabbitMQ connection strings as well as make other changes like changing the RPC url.

The public key of your vault will be present in the `.env` file. Make sure to fund it with some SOL on the network you want to use in order to pay gas fees and rent for the Nonce accounts.

Now, you can run the API server by running the following command -

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm run start
```

```bash yarn
yarn start
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm start
```

</CodeGroup>

You can also run the API server in development mode by running the following command -

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm run dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dev
```

</CodeGroup>

Note that the API server also runs the worker process which listens for new transactions and processes them.
